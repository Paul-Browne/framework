<h1>MEN WALK ON THE MOON</h1><h2>Astronauts Land On Plain;<br>Collect Rocks, Plant Flag</h2><h3>A Powdery Surface Is Closely Explored</h3><p>Houston, Monday, July 21 — Men have landed and walked on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon">moon</a>.</p><p>Two Americans, astronauts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11">Apollo 11</a>, steered their fragile four-legged lunar module safely and smoothly to the historic landing yesterday at 4:17:40 P.M., Eastern daylight time.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong">Neil A. Armstrong</a>, the 38-year-old civilian commander, radioed to earth and the mission control room here:</p><blockquote>Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.</blockquote><p>The first men to reach the moon — Mr. Armstrong and his co-pilot, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin">Col. Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr</a>. of the Air Force — brought their ship to rest on a level, rock-strewn plain near the southwestern shore of the arid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Tranquillitatis">Sea of Tranquility</a>.</p><p>About six and a half hours later, Mr. Armstrong opened the landing craft's hatch, stepped slowly down the ladder and declared as he planted the first human footprint on the lunar crust:</p><blockquote>That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.</blockquote><p>His first step on the moon came at 10:56:20 P.M., as a television camera outside the craft transmitted his every move to an awed and excited audience of hundreds of millions of people on earth.</p><h4>Tentative Steps Test Soil</h4><p>Mr. Armstrong's initial steps were tentative tests of the lunar soil's firmness and of his ability to move about easily in his bulky white spacesuit and backpacks and under the influence of lunar gravity, which is one-sixth that of the earth.</p><p><q>The surface is fine and powdery,</q> the astronaut reported. <q>I can pick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers like powdered charcoal to the sole and sides of my boots. I only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch. But I can see the footprints of my boots in the treads in the fine sandy particles.</q></p><p>After 19 minutes of Mr. Armstrong's testing, Colonel Aldrin joined him outside the craft.</p><p>The two men got busy setting up another television camera out from the lunar module, planting an American flag into the ground, scooping up soil and rock samples, deploying scientific experiments and hopping and loping about in a demonstration of their lunar agility.</p><p>They found walking and working on the moon less taxing than had been forecast. Mr. Armstrong once reported he was <q>very comfortable.</q></p><p>And people back on earth found the black-and-white television pictures of the bug- shaped lunar module and the men tramping about it so sharp and clear as to seem unreal, more like a toy and toy-like figures than human beings on the most daring and far- reaching expedition thus far undertaken.</p><h4>Nixon Telephones Congratulations</h4><p>During one break in the astronauts' work, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon">President Nixon</a> congratulated them from the White House in what, he said, <q>certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made.</q></p><p><q>Because of what you have done,</q> the President told the astronauts, <q>the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility it required us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to earth.</q></p><p><q>For one priceless moment in the whole history of man all the people on this earth are truly one — one in their pride in what you have done and one in our prayers that you will return safely to earth.</q></p><p>Mr. Armstrong replied:</p><p><q>Thank you Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here representing not only the United States but men of peace of all nations, men with interests and a curiosity and men with a vision for the future.</q></p><p>Mr. Armstrong and Colonel Aldrin returned to their landing craft and closed the hatch at 1:12 A.M., 2 hours 21 minutes after opening the hatch on the moon. While the third member of the crew, Lieut. Col. Michael Collins of the Air Force, kept his orbital vigil overhead in the command ship, the two moon explorers settled down to sleep.</p><p>Outside their vehicle the astronauts had found a bleak world. It was just before dawn, with the sun low over the eastern horizon behind them and the chill of the long lunar nights still clinging to the boulders, small craters and hills before them.</p><p>Colonel Aldrin said that he could see <q>literally thousands of small craters</q> and a low hill out in the distance. But most of all he was impressed initially by the <q>variety of shapes, angularities, granularities</q> of the rocks and soil where the landing craft, code-named Eagle had set down.</p><p>The landing was made four miles west of the aiming point, but well within the designated area. An apparent error in some data fed into the craft's guidance computer from the earth was said to have accounted for the discrepancy.</p><p>Suddenly the astronauts were startled to see that the computer was guiding them toward a possibly disastrous touchdown in a boulder-filled crater about the size of a football field.</p><p>Mr. Armstrong grabbed manual control of the vehicle and guided it safely over the crater to a smoother spot, the rocket engine stirring a cloud of moon dust during the final seconds of descent.</p><p>Soon after the landing, upon checking and finding the spacecraft in good condition, Mr. Armstrong and Colonel Aldrin made their decision to open the hatch and get out earlier than originally scheduled. The flight plan had called for the moon walk to begin at 2:12 A.M.</p><p>Flight controllers here said that the early moon walk would not mean that the astronauts would also leave the moon earlier. The lift-off is scheduled to come at about 1:55 P.M. today.</p><p>Their departure from the landing craft out onto the surface was delayed for a time when they had trouble depressurizing the cabin so that they could open the hatch. All the oxygen in the cabin had to be vented.</p><p>Once the pressure gauge finally dropped to zero, they opened the hatch and Mr. Armstrong stepped out on the small porch at the top of the nine-step ladder.</p><p><q>O.K., Houston, I'm on the porch,</q> he reported, as he descended.</p><p>On the second step from the top, he pulled a lanyard that released a fold-down equipment compartment on the side of the lunar module. This deployed the television camera that transmitted the dramatic pictures of man's first steps on the moon.</p><h4>Ancient Dream Fulfilled</h4><p>It was man's first landing on another world, the realization of centuries of dreams, the fulfillment of a decade of striving, a triumph of modern technology and personal courage, the most dramatic demonstration of what man can do if he applies his mind and resources with single-minded determination.</p><p>The moon, long the symbol of the impossible and the inaccessible, was now within man's reach, the first port of call in this new age of spacefaring.</p><p>Immediately after the landing, Dr. Thomas O. Paine, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, telephoned President Nixon in Washington to report:</p><p><q>Mr. President, it is my honor on behalf of the entire <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> team to report to you that the Eagle has landed on the Sea of Tranquility and our astronauts are safe and looking forward to starting the exploration of the moon.</q></p><p>The landing craft from the Apollo 11 spaceship was scheduled to remain on the moon about 22 hours, while Colonel Collins of the Air Force, the third member of the Apollo 11 crew, piloted the command ship, Columbia, in orbit overhead.</p><p><q>You're looking good in every respect,</q> Mission Control told the two men of Eagle after examining data indicating that the module should be able to remain on the moon the full 22 hours.</p><p>Mr. Armstrong and Colonel Aldrin planned to sleep after the moon walk and then make their preparations for the lift-off for the return to a rendezvous with Colonel Collins in the command ship.</p><p>Apollo 11's journey into history began last Wednesday from launching pad 39-A at Cape Kennedy, Fla. After an almost flawless three-day flight, the joined command ship and lunar module swept into an orbit of the moon yesterday afternoon.</p><p>The three men were awake for their big day at 7 A.M. when their spacecraft emerged from behind the moon on its 10th revolution, moving from east to west across the face of the moon along its equator.</p><p>Their orbit was 73.6 miles by 64 miles in altitude, their speed 3,660 miles an hour. At that altitude and speed, it took about two hours to complete a full orbit of the moon.</p><p>The sun was rising over their landing site on the Sea of Tranquility.</p><p><q>We can pick out almost all of the features we've identified previously,</q> Mr. Armstrong reported.</p><p>After breakfast, on their 11th revolution Colonel Aldrin and then Mr. Armstrong, both dressed in their white pressurized suits, crawled through the connecting tunnel into the lunar module.</p><p>They turned on the electrical power, checked all the switch settings on the cockpit panel and checked communications with the command ship and the ground controllers. Everything was <q>nominal,</q> as the spacemen say.</p><h5>Excerpt taken from the <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0720.html">Newyork Times archive</a></h5>
